Hi. As this blog has been taking shape, I have felt the need to identify different types of posts. Introducing "Promotions". For the second post, I am selecting the first post "type" that will be shown on here, Promotions. These "promotion" posts will be fun or interesting things that I have found on the internet related to software development that I hope you, the reader, will find enjoyable as well. I'll write up a little introduction, maybe some thoughts, and then send them out for you to check out - enjoy!

## Introduction

If you are in the Javascript/React world, you have most likely heard of [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov). When I was first starting out, Dan was one of the first people I watched on YouTube to learn about different concepts related to [React](https://reactjs.org/), especially when I was having trouble grasping a concept or applying one to a real-life problem. What I liked was his way of boiling a concept down to a simple, digestible idea, and building upon that to provide greater understanding. That's what you can expect from [Just Javascript, a course to solidify your mental model on Javascript](https://justjavascript.com/).
